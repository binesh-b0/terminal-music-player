# Terminal Music Player

A simple terminal-based music player built with Rust. This project is a work-in-progress and is part of my journey to learn Rust. The application currently supports basic playback functionality, such as playing, pausing, and adjusting volume for audio files.

## Features

- Play and pause audio tracks
- Adjust volume up and down
- Command-line interface with basic controls

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/binesh-b0/terminal-music-player.git
   cd terminal-music-player
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   Ensure you have Rust installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

- **P**: Play/Pause the current track
- **+**: Increase the volume
- **-**: Decrease the volume
- **Q**: Quit the application

## Learning Goals

- Understanding Rust's memory management and concurrency model
- Working with external crates and libraries
- Building a command-line interface (CLI) application

## Next Steps

- Implement playlist management (add/remove tracks, navigate between tracks)
- Add support for additional audio formats
- Improve error handling and logging
- Explore cross-platform audio support
